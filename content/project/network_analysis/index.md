I started this undergraduate research project in 2021 by studying the paper ["Recognizing Power-law Graphs by Machine Learning Algorithms using a Reduced Set of Structural Features"](https://doi.org/10.5753/eniac.2019.9319), the authors [Alane Marie de Lima](https://www.inf.ufpr.br/amlima/) and [André Luis Vignatti](https://www.inf.ufpr.br/vignatti/) were my advisors.

Now, as my final project for the BSc. in CS, I am researching about [Representation Learning for Frequent Subgraph Mining](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2402.14367) paper. The motivation for this study came from classes of the [ML with Graphs course](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/) offered by Stanford University.
